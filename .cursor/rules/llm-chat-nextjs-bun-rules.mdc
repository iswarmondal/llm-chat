# business-logic

- This is a wrapper of various LLM providers. We provide a unified interface for chatting with multiple LLMs.
- We also provide a way to pay-as-you-go for the LLMs, with a focus on low-cost usage. The user can pay up-front for tokens and consume those tokens as they chat with the provided LLMs.
- The focus is to provide a fast and easy to use interface for chatting with LLMs, with a focus on low-cost usage.

# Design philosophy

- The frontend is implemented in the `client` folder. This is a next.js app.
- The app is designed with a simple and minimalistic neo-brutalist design.
- I have implemented some components like the container, heading text, button, etc. in the brutal-components folder.
- I have also implemented some utils like the ProtectedRoute. This ensures that the user is authenticated before they can access the wrapped pages.
